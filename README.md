# XINTRA LABS (Airbuzzed)
Creating a Repository of Walkthrough for Waifu Lab created by [XINTRA](https://www.xintra.org/). 

Like the first XINTRA lab attempted, the goal of this repository is to document my notes and thought processes for each section of the Airbuzzed one. 
Full innovation credits for this lab goes to [XINTRA's team](https://www.xintra.org/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20our%0AExperienced%20Trainers) and other respective [contributors](https://www.xintra.org/labs#:~:text=BEHIND%20THE%20LAB-,Lab%20Contributors,-Each%20lab%20is). 

More information about the labs can be found [here](https://www.xintra.org/labs).

## Repo:
This time around, I've uploaded the walkthrough as one [singular scroll]() ðŸ“œ
- For those who'd like to read the entire walkthrough as one [singular scroll](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_Waifu_Uni_Walkthrough/tree/main/Complete%20Walkthrough) 
  
- Will need more time to push it up section by section at a later date.
